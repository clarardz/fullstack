        <h2 id="what">What is caffeine?</h2>
        <p>Caffeine is a stimulant drug that is widely consumed by people all over the world, mainly in the form of coffee, tea, energy drinks, and some medications. It acts on the central nervous system, providing a temporary boost in energy, alertness, and mental focus. However, excessive caffeine consumption can also have several negative effects on the body.</p>
        <h2 id="physical">Physical Effects</h2>
        <p>Caffeine stimulates the release of adrenaline, leading to an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. It also stimulates the release of stomach acid, leading to indigestion and stomach upset. It also acts as a diuretic, causing increased urination, which can lead to dehydration. Caffeine also affects sleep, leading to insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns.
            The physical effects of caffeine are primarily due to its ability to stimulate the central nervous system and increase the release of certain hormones in the body. Some of the most common physical effects of caffeine include:

            Increased heart rate: Caffeine stimulates the release of adrenaline, which increases heart rate and blood pressure. This can cause palpitations, rapid heartbeat, and a feeling of jitteriness.

            Boost in energy: Caffeine stimulates the release of glucose from the liver, providing a temporary boost in physical energy. However, this can also lead to decreased energy levels when the effects of caffeine wear off.

            Dehydration: Caffeine acts as a diuretic, increasing urine production and leading to dehydration. This can cause headaches, fatigue, and decreased physical performance.

            Digestive issues: Caffeine stimulates the release of stomach acid, which can lead to indigestion, heartburn, and nausea.

            Increased breathing rate: Caffeine stimulates breathing, which can cause rapid or shallow breathing, especially in individuals who are sensitive to its effects.

            It is important to note that the physical effects of caffeine vary from person to person and can be influenced by factors such as tolerance, body weight, and individual sensitivity. Additionally, excessive caffeine consumption can lead to negative physical effects, including addiction, withdrawal symptoms, and increased risk of certain health problems.
        </p>
        <h2 id="mental">Mental Effects</h2>
        <p>Caffeine can have both positive and negative effects on mental health. It can improve cognitive performance and reduce feelings of fatigue. However, it can also lead to anxiety, restlessness, and jitteriness. Additionally, withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability, and fatigue can occur when caffeine consumption is abruptly discontinued.
            Caffeine has several effects on mental processes, which can both enhance and impair cognitive performance. Some of the most common mental effects of caffeine include:

        Improved alertness: Caffeine can increase alertness and reduce feelings of fatigue, making it easier to concentrate and stay focused.

        Enhanced memory: Caffeine can improve memory recall and cognitive performance, making it easier to learn new information and retain it over time.

        Increased anxiety: Caffeine can cause feelings of anxiety, restlessness, and jitteriness, especially in individuals who are sensitive to its effects. This can impair mental performance and lead to decreased overall well-being.

        Decreased sleep quality: Caffeine can interfere with sleep, leading to insomnia or disrupted sleep patterns. This can lead to decreased mental performance and increased fatigue.

        Withdrawal symptoms: Regular caffeine consumption can lead to dependence and addiction, and withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, irritability, and fatigue can occur when caffeine consumption is abruptly discontinued.

        <h2 id="side">Side Effects</h2>
        <p>Regular caffeine consumption can lead to dependence and addiction. Tolerance to caffeine may develop, meaning that more of it is needed to achieve the same effects. Withdrawal symptoms can occur after reducing or discontinuing caffeine
